# Read 02

## All of these note are taken from Dukett HTML and JS book

## Ch.2 Text

- when creating a web page you add tags known as markup to the contents of the page. these tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page. 

*Structural Markup* the ellements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

*Semantic Markup* which provides extra info such as where emphasis is placed in the sentance. that something you have written is a quotation, the meaning of acronyms and so on. 

## HTML has 6 levels of heading  

- these are h brakets. 

*there are also p brackets which permit you to write in paragraph format. 

- enclosing a b in brackets will make the written words on the page ##bold## same thing as italisising something with an i bracket.

- there is sup and sub which are subscript and superscrip brackets.

~ you can make code easier to read when you add extra spaces in the indendtation.
 
- line breaks & horizontal rules are br / and hr / brackets respectivly. these put particular breaks on the page to seperate lines.

- there is <strong> <em> <blockquote> <q>. these add particulare empasis on each of their contnent. 

- with <abbr> you can abbreviate & and add acronyms

- with <cite> and <dif> you'll add citations and definitions.

## Ch. 10 Introducing CSS

- CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. 

-  The key to understanding how CSS works is to understant that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. 

- CSS allows you to crate rules taht control the way that each individual box and the contents of that box is presented. 

* PG. 231 for a solid example. 

- There is both internal and external CSS.

- When using external css you need to < link href type and rel   >
- When using internal < style >

## pg. 238 for the css list of selectors

- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change , and the values of those properties. 

- CSS rules usually appear in a sebarate doc. although they may appear within an HTML page. 

## Ch. 2 Basic JavaScript Instructions

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individiual instruction or step is known as a satement. statements should end with a semicolon. ;

- Statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line. 
- Statement can be organized into code blocks. 

- You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This will help others who are trying to read your code. // 

- A script will have to temporarily store the bits of info it needs to do its job. it can store this data in cariables. 
- when you write JS you have to tell the interpreter every individual step that you want it to preform. this sometimes involeves more detail than you might ezpect. 
- a variable is a good name for this concept since the data stored in a variable can change each tiime the script runs.

## PG. 60 for an example. 

- There are dif. data types. 
1. numeric data type = 1.3
2. string data type = 'hello marcus'
3. boolean data type = true or false

- Array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value. It stores a list of values. 

- Expressions vealuate into a single value. Meaning there are two types of expressions.
1. expressions that assign a value to avariable.
2. expresions that use two or more values to return a single value. 

- Expressions rely on things called operators. They allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

## look to pg. 82 for an example on code.

- Lookig at a flowchart, the code can make more than one path, which means that the browser runs different code in differeent situations.

- there are two components to a decision:
1. an expression is evaluated, which returns a value.
2. a conditional statement says what to do in a given situation. 

- At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a coparison operator to return a true or false value. 

- the IF statement evaluates or checks a condition. if the condition evaluates to be TRUE any statement in the subsequient code block are exevcuted. 

- An else statement piece of code will run if the IF statment was not met with a TRUE response. 







> this is how you quote.

~ Strikethrough.


*italic*

This is how you create a link. [you can read this](thisistheurl.com)

!(you'll read this about the image)(this is the image link.com)

- and * will make an unorderd list.

1. and so on will make an orderd list. 

1. first list item.
   - this is the first nested list item
     - this is the second.
