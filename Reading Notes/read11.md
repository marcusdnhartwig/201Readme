### Ch. 16 'Images'

- Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

- You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS just like you can for any other box. 

- Rather than using the < img > element's align attribute, we are now increasingly using the 'float' property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved.
  1. The Float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
  2. New Classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. these clsass names are used in addition to class that indicates the size of the image. 

- By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow withi the surrounding text.
