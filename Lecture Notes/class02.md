## Data types

- a way of laveling and organizing our data
- a way to format data tha tour program can anticipate and use properly

* JS is a **losely typed** and **dynamic** language

- loosely typed meaning that we dont hae to know the type of data to declare a variable.
- variables do not need to be declared with a type.

`let cat;`

- dynamic meaning that i can chnge the type of data after the variable has been declared.

`cat = 3;`

`cat = 'cuddly';`

`cat = false;`

### numbers

- `4` `1.24` `-200`

### Strings

- Notated with `''`
- double quotes are not best practice.
- `'hello'` `'4'` 

### Booleans

- `true` or `false`

### Undefined

- Something that does not YET have a definition or no console value. 

### Null

- defined as none. 
- the diffrence between undefined and null an undifined is that undifined will result in an error and stop the code in its tracts. 

### Conditionals - IF/ELSE 

- ?am I hungry?
- IF = yes ... eat
- IF = no ... am i bored?
- ELSE IF bored = yes ... go outside
- ELSE bored = no ... take a nap
